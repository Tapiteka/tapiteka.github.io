                Within the Chommell Sector of the southern Mid-Rim, Naboo's royal capital of 
                Theed is located just north of the planet's Lake Country on the edge of the Gallo Mountains bordering the beautiful Lake Paonga. 
                It's flowing waterways, elegant architecture, and smooth stonework boast a rich and artistic history. 
                With a galactically renowned theater that could rival Coruscant's famous Opera and a surprisingly
                robust retirement community, Theed is the ultimate tourist destination!
            </p>
            <p>
                Theed is centrally located between many famous sites and natural attractions. Come watch the sunset from Virdugo Plunge, 
                take a ship below Lake Paonga to Otoh Gunga, hike the Gallo Mountains, or spend a day at the villas scattered through Lake Country. Explore
                the rich flora and large fauna of Naboo from the branching waterways or watch the sun set from the city's cliffsides.
