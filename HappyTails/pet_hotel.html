            At Family Pet Resort, we are an all-inclusive all-suites resort that provides everything for your pet during their
            stay with us. We are happy to provide every guest with plush bedding and plenty of toys, so there’s no need to
            bring any from home. We proudly serve Canidae brand Low Residue dog food; however, if you choose to
            provide your own food, please provide pre-measured baggies with feeding instructions. For those dogs with a
            sweet tooth, ice cream treats and biscuits are available, as well as gourmet stuffed kong treats.
        </p>

            What do you have in mind when you think of a typical boarding kennel? You will not find a more elite kennel in
            Pennsylvania. Please come in and visit us and see for yourself what sets our family friendly resort apart from the
            other kennels. Our canine accommodations offer all the services you would expect from a five-star resort
            including room service, maid service, soothing music and clean & comfortable climate-controlled suites. Our
            state of the art facilities also exchange fresh air throughout the resort approximately 6 to 8 times per hour.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luxury Suites start from Only $32.00 per night.

            with multiple pets.
